$TODO LIST
- Generate detailed Visibility Info in PVSLookupTable (heuristic, terribly need a lot of work even though now's spatialbias is -600)
- Add Static/Dormancy Actor func
- Enable Pause Replication to reduce actor's respawn overhead
- Process to block MulticastRPC when enemy actor is hiding
- If we don't see enemy actor, should still hear its sound
- To reduce memory footprint, need to compress FIntPoint into other data structure like one-dimentional uint16..
- porting to Iris's Dynamic Filter in the future
